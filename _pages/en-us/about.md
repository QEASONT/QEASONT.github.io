## Biography

I am Tang Qian, a Master's student at Zhejiang University's School of Computer Science and Technology. My research focuses on indexing and querying metric spaces, particularly nearest neighbor search in high-dimensional spaces.

I'm currently working on distributed graph-based indexing techniques to enhance similarity search performance in large-scale environments. My work has been published in IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering (TKDE) and other venues.

For more details about my publications, experience, and achievements, please visit my [CV](/cv/) page.
