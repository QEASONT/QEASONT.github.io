:confetti_ball: First Prize in 2024 CCF China Database Competition

<!-- Our team has won first prize in the 2024 CCF China Database Summer Competition! In this competition, we designed and implemented an efficient distributed similarity search system that performed exceptionally well on high-dimensional datasets.

The competition attracted over 150 teams from universities across China. Our solution employed an innovative distributed graph index structure that achieved significant advantages in query performance and system scalability. Special thanks to all team members for their collaboration and to our advisors for their guidance.

This experience not only enhanced our technical capabilities but also deepened our understanding of database system design. We plan to further refine this system and are considering open-sourcing it for academic reference. -->
