:confetti_ball: DIMS Paper Accepted by IEEE TKDE

<!-- Our research paper "DIMS: Distributed Index for Similarity Search in Metric Spaces" has been accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering (TKDE). -->

<!-- This work proposes a novel distributed indexing framework for efficiently addressing similarity search problems in large-scale metric spaces. The DIMS framework balances query performance, scalability, and maintenance costs. Experiments on various real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach offers significant advantages over existing techniques. -->

<!-- Special thanks to all co-authors including Yifan Zhu, Chengyang Luo, and others for their contributions, as well as to our laboratory for providing the research environment and resources. A preprint of the paper has been uploaded to our lab website, with the official version to be published later this year. -->
